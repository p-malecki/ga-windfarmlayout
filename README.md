# Wind Farm Layout Optimization using Genetic Algorithms

This project focuses on optimizing wind farm layouts using genetic algorithms (GAs), aiming to maximize energy production efficiency.

## Overview

The optimization problem involves determining the optimal placement of wind turbines within a specified area to harness maximum wind energy. Genetic algorithms are employed for their ability to efficiently explore the solution space and find near-optimal solutions.

## Key Components

- **Genetic Algorithms Implementation**: Implemented using both custom algorithms and PyGAD library for comparison and optimization.
  
- **Wind Farm Model**: Utilizes the PyWake model to simulate wake effects and calculate the fitness of each layout configuration based on energy output.

- **Main Solution**: The best-performing solution can be found in `main_project_solution.ipynb`, showcasing the optimal layout identified through the optimization process.

- **Documentation and Presentation**: Detailed documentation is available, including a presentation that explains the problem domain and the workings of genetic algorithms (`Wind Farm Layout Optimization problem - presentation.pdf`). Refer to (`Optymalizacja_układu_turbin_w_elektrowniach_wiatrowych_z_zastosowaniem_algorytmów_genetycznych.pdf`) for additional detailed documentation on the project.
